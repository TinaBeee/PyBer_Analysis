## PyBer Ride-hail data analysis

Analysis of ficticious ride-hail data to determine trip demand, price and driver supply by city type

### Overview of Project
The analysis consisted of two separate CSV files - one containing info about different cities and their driver counts, including the type of city, the other containing individual trip data, including the time of the trip and the fare. We merged and analyzed the data to determine differences in trip demand, driver count and pricing based on whether trips were booked in a rural, suburban or urban setting.

### Resources
- Data source: ride_data.csv, city_data.csv
- Software: Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0, Pandas library, Matplotlib library

### Results
When filtering trips by city types (rural, suburban, urban), we immediately see that the majority of trips take place in urban settings, attracting the highest number of drivers:

When drilling down into individual characteristics, we we can look at each individual metric as a share by city type.
Selecting overall trips, we see the outsized impact of urban centers:

As a result, a vast majority of drivers gravitate towards working in urban centers:

But when we consider the share of overall fare revenue generated by city type, we see that rural and suburban trips make of a larger portion:

#### Average fares per ride
The higher percentage of overall fares generated from trips in suburban and rural settings is a result of the higher prices being charged in those locations.
Average trip fares in rural settings are more than 40% higher than those in urban settings. Drivers earn an outsized amount per trip in rural areas, compared to urban centers. But the available data does not allow us to dissect trip fares on a per-mile basis. Rural trips presumably are higher-mileage than urban trips, potentially dilluting driver earnings on a per-mile basis.

#### Seasonal effects
The distribution of overall trips by city type is also visible when looking at total fares on a weekly basis. The range provided in the raw data set allows us to analyze trips between January 2019 and the end of April 2019.
Total fare amounts in urban and suburban areas start low at the beginning of Januaury, but then quickly pick up, with total fares in urban centers reaching their peaks in late February and early March, and in late February in the suburbs. Total fares in rural areas also peak in late February and see another bump at the start of April, but overall remain more steady than in the other city types:

### Summary
The data provided offers limited insight into the operations at fictional ride-hail company PyBer. Recommendations for further analysis include:

- Provide the mileage for each trip: This would allow for a more granular analysis and offer a more comparable data on trips.
- Provide data on wait times for each trip: Without wait time data it is hard to establish consumer demand and driver supply levels and distinguish between cause
  and effect. For example, we don't know if trip demand in rural areas is this low due to the low driver count leading to longer wait times, discouraging customers
  living in those areas from booking trips. 
- Increasing driver supply in suburban areas: while suburban rides make up more than 26% of all trips and more than 30% of the total fare revenue, suburban areas
  account for only 12.5% of the total driver count. While it is hard to guarantee without wait time data, the current data suggests that there is sufficient trip
  demand in suburban areas to justify increased driver supply without diminishing ride prices too much.
